### Bugs

- <b>Issue</b>
The nextQuestion function would not iterate through the questionArray to display the questions.

- <b>Solution</b>
Many attempts where made to change the relavant statement to no avail. After some time, it was discovered that the syntax within the array itself was faulty and was promptly fixed. The style of the array was derived from the 'Display Quiz Questions' section of this [Link](https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/).

- <b>Issue</b>
The clickable buttons on the homepage appear to have some styling around the top edges which cannot be removed at this time.

- <b>Solution</b>
This issue remains however, has no impact on the flow of the game or user experience.

## Deployment
The game was deployed with GitHub using the below steps:

- Within the relavant repository, select 'Settings'.
- Navigate to the 'Pages' section displayed on the left menu.
- Select the main branch from the drop-down menu and save to display the link to your website.
